      PALO ALTO, Calif. (December 16, 1999 8:33 a.m. EST <font size=-2>http://www.nandotimes.com</font>) - Angus Davis told his folks not to worry when he was ejected from a prestigious Massachusetts prep school for hacking into the telephone system. 
<P> But even Davis couldn't have predicted that in less than five 
years he would leverage his scofflaw talents to secure $53 million 
in funding for a company trying to combine the power of the World 
Wide Web with the convenience of the telephone. 
<P> On Wednesday, Davis - who at 21 is barely old enough to pop a 
bottle of champagne - announced that he and his partners at their 
telephone information company, Tellme Networks Inc., have received 
$47 million in funding from venture capital firms Benchmark Capital 
and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The new round of investment 
brings the company's total funding to $53 million. 
<P> To be sure, Davis isn't the only young person in the Silicon 
Valley receiving venture capital these days. In the three months 
ended September, venture capitalists poured $3.36 billion into San 
Francisco Bay area companies, $2 billion of that going to Internet companies, according to a Money Tree survey. 
<P> But colleagues say Davis is particularly young. In addition, he and his partners are managing to bring to their business a series of unusual alliances - investors from companies like the former 
Netscape Communications Corp. and bitter rival Microsoft Corp. 
<P> "We sought out that funding on purpose," Davis said. "It 
would be easy for us to get money. But we wanted those particular 
investors behind us because they know what they're doing." 
<P> At the heart of his team, which has grown to 51 employees this 
month, is Davis, an unusually intelligent, rosy-cheeked young man 
who chose Netscape over college four years ago and has been riding 
the Internet wave ever since. 
<P> At Netscape, one of his primary duties was working with Justice 
Department attorneys suing Microsoft. He also helped develop the 
Netcenter Web portal which would become the company's hallmark 
product. 
<P> When Netscape was bought by America Online Inc. last year, Davis 
struck out on his own again. 
<P> By then, he had more than a decade of high-tech experience under 
his belt. He began programming at 8, worked for an Internet service 
provider in high school and created Web pages as a hobby as a teen. 
<P> Then there were his problems at Phillips Academy, the tony 
Andover, Mass., prep school from which his father and grandfather 
had graduated before heading to Yale University and Harvard Law 
School. 
<P> Davis, an only child, ended that family tradition when he got 
caught hacking into the school's telephone system so he could make 
calls without paying for them. 
<P> Phillips Academy communications director Sharon Britton 
confirmed that Davis left the school prematurely in 1995, but would 
not say why. 
<P> Four years later, his telephone techniques are coming in handy. 
<P> Joining with former Netscape vice president of technology Mike 
McCue, who chose IBM over college 14 years earlier, Davis founded 
Tellme Networks to bring the Internet revolution to the telephone. 
<P> McCue said Davis' youth is a distinct advantage to their 
company. 
<P> "He doesn't know necessarily what can't be done," said McCue. 
"He's incredibly positive and convinces all of us to go for things 
we might otherwise try to avoid." 
<P> Their seed money - $6 million - came from the unusual alliance 
of James Barksdale, Netscape's former CEO, and his business rival 
Brad Silverberg, who used to lead Microsoft Corp.'s Internet 
strategy. 
<P> Barksdale said that when Netscape originally hired Davis, he was 
dubious about his youth. 
<P> "But he's one of the brightest, most clever people you could 
run into," he said. 
<P> Barksdale pointed out that Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, Apple 
Computer Corp. interim CEO Steve Jobs and Oracle Corp. CEO Larry 
Ellison are just a few of the high-tech leaders who never graduated 
from college. 
<P> Barksdale said he has total faith in Davis and his colleagues at 
Tellme, even though the company has been somewhat vague about what 
it's going to sell. 
<P> According to a statement released Wednesday, Tellme's new 
technology will allow consumers to speak simple voice commands into 
telephones and gain access to a variety of different consumer 
services. These could include obtaining stock quotes and driving 
directions or even ordering items. 
<P> Internet analyst Seamus McAteer, director of Web technology 
strategies at Jupiter Communications, said the Tellme team has "an 
ambitious agenda." 
<P> "They're trying to succeed where others have failed in the 
past," he said. "But if they succeed technically, what they do 
will be very difficult to replicate."
