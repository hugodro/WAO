<img src="/images/r.gif" alt=R align=left border=0 height=34 width=33>OME -- Last week in Britain, following news of strong sales from the major mobile phone companies over the holiday shopping season, the news media reported that just slightly under 24 million people in Britain one-fourth of the people in the country -- now own a mobile phone.
<p>
Britons are just the latest to be taken with this one-time accouterment, now social and business necessity. According to <a href=#1>Forrester Research</a>, a consulting company in Cambridge, Mass., half of the people in Italy own a cellular phone, while in Norway, Sweden and Finland ownership is even higher. Across Western Europe, more than one out of every three people totes a mobile phone.

This European zest for mobile communications has not escaped the notice of the media companies. In fact, the mobile phone is increasingly seen as a bridge between the converging worlds of traditional media and the Internet. The ubiquitous mobile phone, and other wireless devices for that matter, offers an obvious way to reach a broader European audience, especially when one considers the comparatively low numbers of Internet-connected PCs. 
<p>
"Take, for example, Italy, where there are five mobile phones for every computer that's connected to the Net," said Matthew Nordan, a senior analyst with Forrester. "If you want to expand your market by moving beyond people who buy newspapers to people who use other communications media, the Web is probably not the right place to go to get lots and lots of them. But cell phones are a perfect one." 
<p>
A Forrester report directed by Nordan found that 9 out of 10 Internet executives in Europe plan to launch Internet sites specifically for mobile devices. Nordan predicts that by 2004, 34 percent of Europeans will regularly use the Internet this way. 
<p>
Updates from news organizations have proven to be among the most popular of the wireless services, which can either function as an e-mail service, receiving news headlines and stock quotes, or can work more like a Web browser on a PC, reading special pared-down Internet sites. 
<p>
"News seems to be the big winner so far, based on evidence from Norway," said Lars Godell, an analyst with Forrester in Amsterdam who follows mobile developments in Scandinavia. 
<p>
"They have this data that already exists," Nordan said. "With a little bit of programming effort, it can be trimmed down, sliced and diced and put onto a cell phone." 
<p>
But, it is also a big revenue opportunity for the media companies. 
<p>
"Because it's a pay-per-use service," Nordan said, "content providers can actually make money off of their content directly without selling a subscription. Cell phones can give them micropayments for free, which for many media providers has been the holy grail of the Internet that's just never materialized." 
<p>
In places like Finland, where mobile phone use is high, this has already proven true in older wireless platforms. 
<p>
"I think it's a potentially very large new market for us," said Jonathan Baile, managing director of Reuters Wireless Services. 
<p>
Reuters, based in Britain, is the world's largest news and television agency that supplies news, graphics, video pictures and data to Web sites, print media and television around the world. 
<p>
"I think that in a very short number of years, more people will access Internet-based information on wireless devices than they do on wired," Baile said in a telephone interview from Reuters headquarters in London. 
<p>
"Our ultimate aim," Baile said, "is for anyone, anywhere, anytime to get access to highly personalized information direct from Reuters."

"It's very important," said Neil Martinson, head of media relations for the BBC. "If 40 percent of the U.K. population has mobile phones, it's not something we can ignore." 
<p>
BBC, which is supported by a license fee paid by residents of Britain, offers news services in Britain and news throughout the world on radio, TV and the Internet. 
<p>
"What's pretty clear," Martinson said from BBC Television Center in London, "is that the way in which people are consuming news is rapidly changing." 
<p>
For whatever reason, new social patterns, a shift in demographics, a longer work day or differing expectations, Martinson said that the audience has always changed the way it wants to get news. 
<p>
"Over a period of time, audiences to traditional news programs will decline," Martinson said. "If you take TV news, people in the U.K. tended to make an appointment to view. They knew the news was on at 6 o'clock or 9 o'clock. Over the years, there's been a gradual decline in those audiences." 
<p>
"Mobile devices are clearly the logical next step in terms of insuring within the U.K. that people who pay the license fee to the BBC can get the BBC news when they want, wherever they are." 
<p>
For reasons of convenience or otherwise, Poligrafici Editoriale, publisher of three of Italy's leading regional papers, has reached a broader audience through the mobile phone. Marco Pratellesi, the online editor for La Nazione, il Resto del Carlino, il Giorno and Quotidiano, believes that they have reached first-time readers through their mobile phone news service. 
<p>
Poligrafici Editoriale currently has 100,000 subscribers to their wireless news service, offered in conjunction with Telecom Mobile Italia. 
<p>
"We are planning to charge a little fee for the service later this year," Pratellesi said. "Our hopes are for a large number of users and, maybe, income from advertising." 
<p>
There are still doubts as to what sort of information people will want to get on their mobile phone. Some remain skeptical that with a screen as small as five lines, people will want to read full-text articles. But others say devices like personal digital assistants, or PDA's, could complement mobile phones. 
<p>
The mobile phone is perfect for providing targeted information, Nordan said. "For financial news this is absolutely critical." 
<p>
"It's an intimate personal device that lots of folks use," Nordan said. "You can, by working with a mobile operator, have some specific information about each and every subscriber and very tightly personalize all the content and potentially ads or sponsorship that you bring to them." 
<p>
"Whatever it is," Baile said, "it's going to be personalized." 
<p>
Although the current wireless networks are limited in the rate of data transmission -- it is still far below the speed of the typical modem -- the next generation of wireless network, often called 3G, promises transfer speeds 60 times faster than today's modems. With these speeds, audio and video will be quite reasonable. Reuters and the BBC are both developing products with this in mind. 
<p>
Whether this sort of service will be available to everyone, however, is still to be determined. These networks will be expensive to construct and analysts expect they will be limited to areas of dense population.
