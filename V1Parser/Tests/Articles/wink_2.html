<p><CONTENT><b>Interactive television is something that people have been talking  about for a really long time; some networks attempted it and failed  in the early 1990s. In fact, some say that it already failed as an  industry. Why has Wink stuck it through? What's changed?</b></P>

<P>There have been three or four key things that are different today that  make it possible to be successful. First and foremost, there's a lot  more power being put on top of the television in the set-top box --  we don't add any hardware cost to the existing set-top box already  rolling out, we're actually just leveraging the capabilities that are  already in those boxes. Secondly, the Web has been a huge fertile  ground for content development -- especially informational content.  We can automatically pull data from the Web and display it as an  overlay on top of video, so it's very inexpensive to develop content  for Wink. Before you had to have people creating all this data from  scratch, and it was a very expensive proposition.</P>

<P>Also, consumers are getting very comfortable pointing and clicking  with a computer from an e-commerce perspective. That habit of being  able to buy with one click also helps us with the e-commerce on Wink.</P>

<P><b>What was the biggest mistake the interactive television industry  was making before?</b></P>

<P>The interactive experiments were approached from a destination  perspective -- in other words, you went to a channel to interact. The  beauty about Wink is that we don't have to drive you anywhere to  interact -- you simply do it on top of the shows you're already  watching. It's geared around why consumers watch TV in the first  place: to watch video.</P>

<P><b>There are 10 million Wink-capable installed boxes today, but there  are only 150,000 people using it now. What's holding you back?</b></P>

<P>The boxes have the capabilities, but we still have to cut the deals with the cable operators to deploy on those  platforms. We have agreements for over 6 million homes in the next two  years; it's now just a matter of rolling out in all of those markets.  We started the rollout several months ago.</P>

<P><b>How much content is being embedded in the shows, and how much  staff does it require to create it?</b></P>

<P>It depends. We have six or seven networks today where Wink is  available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. On the Weather Channel or  CNBC you can pull up weather or financial information by company,  team or city. Once we set up the template, that data is refreshed and  updated every 10 minutes from their Web site. It takes a couple weeks  of work to develop the application, but once it's developed there's  no more human intervention because we have an automatic feed.</P>

<P>We also use Wink to enhance events, like the Ryder Cup for NBC. It  was a three-day golf event, where we were providing data like match-ups  against the players and statistics on golfers. That's more labor  intensive -- someone was working at that event. But again, NBC does  it for their Web site as well, so we're leveraging the same person.</P>

<P>The average network has a full-time person working on Wink.</P>

<P><b>It seems like this technology is ripe for product placement --  where you click on the wallpaper in the latest episode of "Friends" and  buy it.</b></P>

<P>I think product placement e-commerce is something we'll see 24 months  from now -- the boxes that are in the homes today just don't have the  capability to do that yet, but we do see the next generation of boxes  as being able to provide functionality for those kinds of services.</P>

<P><b>What's proven to be the most popular function with consumers? </b></P>

<P>Informational channels are very high usage -- ESPN, sporting events,  the Weather Channel, CNN. On an individual show basis, shows like the  "Jay Leno Show," or the "CBS Morning Show" do well -- for example on  "Leno," during the monologue, you can pull up lists of guests he'll  have on the show, and when the guests come on we have bio and trivia  information about them. If he's featuring a band or new act you can  actually buy the CD.  On the "CBS Morning Show," you can click and get  recipes.</P>

<P><b>How popular has e-commerce been so far?</b></P>

<P>We started running our first commercials last month -- we had 300 ads  in October, we'll do about 500 this month, and we're seeing a very  good response rate: Anywhere from 5 to 15 percent actually click through on the  ad, and then responses of 50 to 75 percent once they see the offer. Very, very  robust.</P>

<P><b>You decided to overlay the information on top of the show, rather than  taking people to the Internet. Why did you decide not to provide Net  access?</b></P>

<P>Two reasons: One, we are a TV-centric service -- we are not about the  Web on TV, which is a subscription service. Our service is free.  Secondly, our service is mass market -- available to anyone who has a  TV set that subscribes to cable or DirectTV service. And we're very  friendly to the networks: The networks want to see people on their  programming, not taking them <i>away</i> from their programming,  which is what a browser service does.</P>

<P><b>How did you personally end up at Wink?  You were at AT&T?</b></P>

<P>Yeah, I got kidnapped! I had a great job at AT&T; I was chief  operating officer of the wireless division, and had been in the  wireless business for close to seven years. I spent 12 years in the  cable business before that -- I ran the largest management  information systems and billing company in the cable industry. So I  did have a very good background in understanding transaction  processing and putting systems together; I also had a lot of  relationships in the cable industry because of my years in the  business.</P>

<P>I saw some of the interactive TV experiments when I was in the cable  business, and knew a lot about the space. And when I saw the Wink  system, it was the first time I saw a system that had a business model  that could absolutely work; it had all the elements: being easy for  consumers and free, an elegant technology that didn't require a lot  of money, that it could leverage the content on the Web, and was very  focused on enhancing the current viewing experience.</P>

<P><b>What's your favorite gadget?</b></P>

<P>My cell phone -- it's my most favorite gadget. My remote control is  also a very favorite gadget of mine in the home -- I have a DirectTV  service and cable, so I use all of the remotes. And I actually got my  first Palm Pilot a few weeks ago and I'm trying to use it. I'm sure  that will become another one!</P>

<P>I'm a TVaholic -- it's funny, when I talk to my folks, they say "It's  interesting that the two things you did constantly as a kid were talk  on the phone and watch TV. Those are the businesses you've excelled  at."</P>

<P><b>What's the biggest technical disaster you've faced in the past,  and what technical hurdles do you see in the future for Wink?</b></P>

<P>At AT&T Wireless, one of the biggest disasters was when Hurricane  Andrew knocked out 123 cell sites on our network -- we had to  re-deploy a number of our technical people from all over the country.  In a matter of 30 days we restored 100 percent service. That was the biggest  disaster I ever faced.</P>

<P>The biggest technical challenge for Wink is making sure that we  continue to leverage new enhancements in technology, making sure that  we never lose sight of simplicity for the customer.</CONTENT><BR><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b>salon.com</b>  |  Nov.  22, 1999</font><BR>
